## About this book {-}

This book is focused on practical software examples and data explorations. There are few equations, but a great deal of code.

We don't assume any previous knowledge of XXX.

## Using code examples {-}

This book was written in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) using [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/). The [website](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and automatically built after every push by [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/actions).

This version of the book was built with `r R.version.string` and the following packages:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
deps <- desc::desc_get_deps()
pkgs <- sort(deps$package[deps$type == "Imports"])
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(pkgs, dependencies = FALSE)
df <- tibble::tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```
